When you are in the "Enter Text" box you can just enter text as usual or you can add a simple tag in the beginning to format the text.

If you want to bold your text put "<b>" ( minus the quotes ) at the beginning and anything afterwards will be bold.
So if you want to bold the word "Wood" in your sign you would simply put "<b>Wood" in the sign text box and when you hit "Ok" it will be bold!

Working tags found so far:
<b>Makes text Bold
<i>Makes text Italic
<u>Underlines Text
<color=white>Changes Text Color ( Use color names only - No Hex )
<sub>Makes Subscript Text ( Smaller text at the bottom )
<sup>Makes Superscript Text ( Smaller text at the top )
<mark>Puts A Yellow Background Behind The Text ( My new favorite! )
<br>Breaks Into A New Line ( Stack words up to 2 rows )
