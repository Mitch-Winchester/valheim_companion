# Valheim Companion App #
#########################

HOW TO USE:
- To run the web app, simply open the file "valheim_companion.html". This will open the home page.
- Once the home page loads, use the buttons to select a secondary page to open. The buttons labeled, 
    "Tools", "Weapons", and "Armor" currently only display a pop-up informing the user that they are under control
- To go back to the home page, simply click the "Back to Home" button at the bottom of the page, or close the browser tab.

TIPS:
- The Food and Mead pages allow the user to filter results in the table. 
    - For mead, the user can search by item name, ingredient name, or effect. 
    - For food, the user can search by item name, ingredient name, biome, or stat type.
        - When filtering by stat type, the user can type, "health" and the app determines which attribute (health, stamina, or eitr)
            is the highest, and displays the foods that have health as their primary stat.
